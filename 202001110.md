## 1. Identify FRs and NFRS

### Functional Requirements
- student / employee login &nbsp;(user login)
    - Borrowing a book
    - Returning a book
    - Extend return data

- library staff login &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(staff login)
    - Managing day to day book transactions

- librarian login     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (admin login)
    - Enter new record corresponding to the purchase of a book
    - Delete a record if any book is taken off the shelf

- Free browsing/searching of books for non-members (users not logged in)

- Issueing or returning book(s) requires user to login

- The final product should be a web application running only on the institute LAN.
- All confidential information should be encrypted before storing.


### Non-Functional Requirements 
- Scalability
    - Large number of employees along with research scholars will be using the system and so, it needs to adapt to deal with such large number of users.

- Authentication
    - The system requires a user to login before placing a request to borrow/return a book, or extend deadline. The system must ensure no user's login details are leaked and used incorrectly to borrow/return books.

- Reliability
    - The database must remain updated to ensure it does not show book available in case it is not currently available (borrowed but not returned) nor should it display a book marked as borrowed by a user when that user has already returned the book.
