- student / employee login &nbsp;(user login)
    - Borrowing a book
    - Returning a book
    - Extend return data
    - Book a book if it is already borrowed by someone else

- Issueing or returning book(s) requires user to login

- The final product should be a web application running only on the institute LAN.
- All confidential information should be encrypted before storing.


### <u>Non-Functional Requirements</u>:
- Scalability
    - Large number of employees along with research scholars will be using the system and so, it needs to adapt to deal with such large number of users.

- Authentication
    - The system requires a user to login before placing a request to borrow/return a book, or extend deadline. The system must ensure no user's login details are leaked and used incorrectly to borrow/return books.

- Reliability
    - The database must remain updated to ensure it does not show book available in case it is not currently available (borrowed but not returned) nor should it display a book marked as borrowed by a user when that user has already returned the book.
    - Ensuring that the user is only able to borrow a book that is currently available and return a book only if (s)he has borrowed it.

- Maintainability
    - The web application can have cability of modifications and updates so that the technology used does not get outdated too quickly and can be easiy updated even if the developer team working on the website changes.
